# simple-webgpu

Simple-webgpu is, as the name suggests, a simple implementation of webgpu
through [Google's Dawn](https://github.com/google/dawn) library implementation.

The project generally consists of setting up the WebGPU pipeline with C, getting
it to output a graphic, creating some sort of user feedback to interact
with and manipulate the graphic, and (maybe) getting the program to run on
multiple operating systems (MacOS + Linux).

WebGPU itself is a graphics library standard, not actual code. We’ve decided to
use the Dawn WebGPU implementation because it is developed by Google and
generally the most used and documented implementation.
